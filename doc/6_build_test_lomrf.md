# Build and Test LoMRF

In order to build from sources and use LoMRF, either as a program or as a programming library, you need to follow 
the [build and link instructions](6_1_build_and_link_lomrf.md).

If you are interested in learning LoMRF by using examples or contribute, we suggest to get the 
[LoMRF-data sub-module](6_2_download_example_data.md). The LoMRF-data contains examples (see, for instance, 
[Inference](2_inference.md)) as well as sample files that are used by Unit testing.
