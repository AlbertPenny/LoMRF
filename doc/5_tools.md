* lomrf infer: Performs probabilistic inference (see `lomrf infer -h` for help).
* lomrf wlearn: Performs weight learning (see `lomrf wlearn -h` for help)
* lomrf slearn: Performs structure learning (see `lomrf slearn -h` for help)
* lomrf compile: Compiles MLN files (predicate completion, CNF, etc.; write `lomrf compile -h` for help).
* lomrf export: Exports ground MRF into various formats (MLN, DIMACS and libDAI Factor graph; write `lomrf export -h` for help).
