# Syntax

LoMRF employs a logic-based language for expressing knowledge files (`*.mln`) and input evidence files (`*.db`):
* [Knowledge base](1_1_knowledge_base.md) is composed of domain type definitions, predicate and function schema definitions, first-order logic formulas, definite clauses, as well as some build-in functions and predicates with additional functionality.
* [Evidence](1_2_evidence.md) is composed of ground predicate facts and function mappings.
